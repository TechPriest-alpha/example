Attempt to implement very basic app with Spring and scala3.

Aim was to try powerful type system of scala to deduce proper processing beans on-the fly.

Unfortunately Scala's type system proved too powerful to me.

For example, I was unable to create a collection like val x: List[LogicFor] = Array(Logic1, Logic2). See Input.scala.

Either there is something very simple I'm missing, or something too complex for me, so I can't understand.

Either way, error messages, documentation and info in Google are very scarce and provide no useful hints on what's going on.

All either are 'hello world' level, or too advanced to grasp without lengthy research.

Current conclusion: not for an average developer, neither for anything enterprise-like.
