Attempt to implement very basic app with Spring and scala3.

So far there was a moderate success.

Certain facilities seem to be working more or less properly (injection, bean search). Though getting Scala type system
to work with Spring methods took some effort  (for future - scala error messages and available documentation are at best 'scarce')
.

Initial issues (getting all beans by type, mocking beans in tests) seem to be resolved. More experiments await :)
